        <p>THere are, no doubt, a supercilious race in the world, who will esteeme all office, done you in this kind, an iniurie; so solemne a vice it is with them to vse the authoritie of their ignorance, to the crying downe of Poetry, or the Professors: But, my gratitude must not leaue to correct their error; since I am none of those, that can suffer the benefits confer'd vpon my youth, to perish with my age. It is a fraile memorie, that remembers but present things: And, had the fauour of the times so conspir'd with my disposition, as it could haue brought forth other, or better, you had had the same proportion, &amp; number of the fruits, the first. Now, I pray you, to accept this, such, wherein neither the confession of my manners shall make you blush; nor of my studies, repent you to haue beene the instructer: And, for the profession of my thanke-fulnesse, I am sure, it will, with good men, find either praise, or excuse. </p>

I protest to you, as I am a gentleman, and a souldier, I ne're chang'd wordes, with his like. By his discourse, he should eate nothing but hay. He was borne for the manger, pannier, or pack-saddle!

            <p>Sir, beleeue mee (vpon my relation) for what I tell you, the world shal not reproue. I haue been in the Indies (where this herb growes) where neither my selfe, nor a dozen gentlemen more (of my knowledge) haue receiued the tast of any other nutriment, in the world, for the space of one and twentie weekes, but the fume of this simple onely. Therefore, it cannot be, but 'tis most diuine! Further, take it in the nature, in the true kind so, it makes an antidote, that (had you taken the most deadly poysonous plant in all Italy, it should expell it, and clarifie you, with as much ease, as I speake. And, for your greene wound, your Balsamum, and your St. IOHN'S woort are all mere gulleries, and trash to it, especially your Trinidado: your Nicotian is good too. I could say what I know of the vertue of it, for the expulsion of rhewmes, raw humours, crudities, obstructions, with a thousand of this kind, but I professe my selfe no quack-saluer. Only, thus much, by HERCVLES, I doe hold it, and will affirme it (before any Prince in Europe) to be the most soueraigne, and precious weede, that euer the earth tendred to the vse of man. </p>
