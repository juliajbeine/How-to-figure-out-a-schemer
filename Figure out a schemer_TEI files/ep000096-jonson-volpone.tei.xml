        <head>TO THE MOST NOBLE AND MOST EQVALL SISTERS THE TWO FAMOVS VNIVERSITIES FOR THEIR LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE SHEW'N TO HIS POEME IN THE PRESENTATION BEN IONSON THE GRATEFVLL ACKNOWLEDGER DEDICATES BOTH IT AND HIMSELFE. </head>
        <pb n="442" xml:id="ep000096-240-a"/>
        <p>NEuer (most equall SISTERS) had any man a wit so presently excellent, as that it could raise it selfe; but there must come both matter, occasion, commenders, and fauourers to it: If this be true, and that the fortune of all writers doth daily proue it, it behoues the carefull to prouide, well, toward these accidents; and, hauing acquir'd them, to preserue that part of reputation most tenderly, wherein the benefit of a friend is also defended. Hence is it, that I now render my selfe gratefull, and am studious to iustifie the bounty of your act: to which, though your mere authority were satisfying, yet, it being an age, wherein Poetrie, and the Professors of it heare so ill, on all sides, there will a reason bee look'd for in the subiect. It is certayne, nor can it with any fore-head be oppos'd, that the too-much licence of Poetasters, in this time, hath much deform'd their Mistris; that, euery day, their manifold, and manifest ignorance, doth sticke vnnaturall reproches vpon her: But for their petulancy, it were an act of the greatest iniustice, either to let the learned suffer; or so diuine a skill (which indeed should not bee attempted with vncleane hands) to fall, vnder the least contempt. For, if men will impartially, and not à-squint, looke toward the offices, and function of a Poet, they will easily conclude to themselues, the impossibility of any mans being the good Poet, without first being a good man. He that <pb n="443" xml:id="ep000096-240-b"/>is said to be able to informe yong-men to all good disciplines, inflame growne-men to all great vertues, keepe old-men in their best and supreme state, or as they decline to child-hood, recouer them to their first strength; that comes forth the interpreter, and arbiter of nature, a teacher of things diuine, no lesse then humane, a master in manners; and can alone (or with a few) effect the businesse of man-kind: this, I take him, is no subiect for pride, and ignorance to exercise their rayling rhetorique vpon. But, it will here be hastily answer'd, that the writers of these dayes are other things; that, not only their manners, but their natures are inuerted; and nothing remayning with them of the dignitie of Poet, but the abused name, which euery Scribe vsurps: that now, especially in dramatick, or (as they terme it) stage-poetrie, nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blasphemy, all licence of offence to god, and man, is practis'd. I dare not denie a great part of this (and am sorry, I dare not) because in some mens abortiue features (and would they had neuer boasted the light) it is ouer-true: But, that all are embarqu'd in this bold aduenture for hell, is a most vncharitable thought, and, vtter'd, a more malicious slander. For my particular, I can (and from a most cleare conscience) affirme, that I haue euer trembled to thinke toward the least prophanenesse; haue lothed the vse of such foule, and vn-wash'd baudry, as is now made the foode of the scene: And, howsoeuer I cannot escape, from some, the imputation of sharpnesse, but that they will say, I haue taken a pride, <pb n="444" xml:id="ep000096-241-a"/>or lust, to be bitter, and not my yongest infant but hath come into the world with all his teeth; I would aske of these supercilious politiques, what nation, societie, or generall order, or state I haue prouok'd? what publique person? whether I haue not (in all these) preseru'd their dignitie, as mine owne person, safe? My workes are read, allow'd, (I speake of those that are intirely mine) looke into them: What broad reproofes haue I vs'd? Where haue I beene particular? Where personall? except to a mimick, cheater, bawd, or buffon, creatures (for their insolencies) worthy to be tax'd? Yet, to which of these so pointingly, as he might not, either ingenuously haue confest, or wisely dissembled his disease? But it is not rumour can make men guiltie, much lesse entitle me, to other mens crimes. I know, that nothing can bee so innocently writ, or carryed, but may be made obnoxious to construction; mary, whil'st I beare mine innocence about mee, I feare it not. Application, is now, growne a trade with many; and there are, that professe to haue a key for the decyphering of euery thing: but let wise and noble persons take heed how they be too credulous, or giue leaue to these inuading interpreters, to bee ouer-familiar with their fames, who cunningly, and often, vtter their owne virulent malice, vnder other mens simplest meanings. As for those, that will (by faults which charitie hath rak'd vp, or common honestie conceal'd) make themselues a name with the multitude, or (to draw their rude, and beastly claps) care not whose liuing faces they intrench, with their petulant stiles; <pb n="445" xml:id="ep000096-241-b"/>may they doe it, without a riuall, for me: I choose rather to liue grau'd in obscuritie, then share with them, in so preposterous a fame. Nor can I blame the wishes of those seuere, and wiser patriots, who prouiding the hurts these licentious spirits may doe in a state, desire rather to see fooles, and deuils, and those antique reliques of barbarisme retriu'd, with all other ridiculous, and exploded follies: then behold the wounds of priuate men, of princes, and nations. For, as HORACE makes TREBATIVS speake, among these <quote>
            <l>— Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intactus, &amp; odit. </l>
          </quote>And men may iustly impute such rages, if continu'd, to the writer, as his sports. The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the present trade of the stage, in all their misc'line enter-ludes, what learned or liberall soule doth not already abhor? where nothing but the filth of the time is vtter'd, and that with such impropriety of phrase, such plenty of soloecismes, such dearth of sense, so bold prolepse's, so rackt metaphor's, with brothelry, able to violate the eare of a pagan, and blasphemy, to turne the bloud of a christian to water. I cannot but be serious in a cause of this nature, wherein my fame, and the reputations of diuers honest, and learned are the question; when a Name, so ful of authority, antiquity, and all great marke, is (through their insolence) become the lowest scorne of the age: and those men subiect to the petulancy of euery vernaculous Orator, that were wont to bee the care of Kings, and happiest Monarchs. This it is, that hath not only rap't me to present <pb n="444" subtype="duplicate" type="blank" xml:id="ep000096-242-a"/>
          <pb n="445" subtype="duplicate" type="blank" xml:id="ep000096-242-b"/>
          <pb n="446" xml:id="ep000096-243-a"/>indignation, but made me studious, heretofore; and, by all my actions, to stand off, from them: which may most appeare in this my latest worke (which you, most learned ARBITRESSES, haue seene, iudg'd, and to my crowne, approu'd) wherein I haue labour'd, for their instruction, and amendment, to reduce, not onely the ancient formes, but manners of the scene, the easinesse, the propriety, the innocence, and last the doctrine, which is the principall end of poesie, to informe men, in the best reason of liuing. And though my catastrophe may, in the strict rigour of comick law, meet with censure, as turning back to my promise; I desire the learned, and charitable critick to haue so much faith in me, to thinke it was done off industrie: For, with what ease I could haue varied it, neerer his scale (but that I feare to boast my owne faculty) I could here insert. But my speciall ayme being to put the snaffle in their mouths, that crie out, we neuer punish vice in our enterludes, &amp;c. I tooke the more liberty; though not without some lines of example, drawne euen in the ancients themselues, the goings out of whose comoedies are not alwaies ioyfull, but oft-times, the bawdes, the seruants, the riuals yea, and the masters are mulcted: and fitly, it being the office of a comick-Poet, to imitate iustice, and instruct to life, as well as puritie of language, or stirre vp gentle affections. To which, I shall take the occasion else-where to speake. For the present (most reuerenced SISTERS) as I haue car'd to be thankefull for your affections past, and here made the vnderstanding acquainted with some <pb n="447" xml:id="ep000096-243-b"/>ground of your fauours; let me not despaire their continuance, to the maturing of some worthier fruits: wherein, if my MVSES be true to me, I shall raise the despis'd head of poetrie againe, and stripping her out of those rotten and base rags, wherwith the Times haue adulterated her form, restore her to her primitiue habit, feature, and maiesty, and render her worthy to be imbraced, and kist, of all the great and master-spirits of our world. As for the vile, and slothfull, who neuer affected an act, worthy of celebration, or are so inward with their owne vicious natures, as they worthily feare her; and thinke it a high point of policie, to keepe her in contempt with their declamatorie, and windy inuectiues: shee shall out of iust rage incite her seruants (who are genus iritabile) to spout inke in their faces, that shall eate, farder then their marrow, into their fames; and not CINNAMVS the barber, with his arte, shall be able to take out the brands, but they shall liue, and bee read, till the wretches dye, as things worst deseruing of themselues in chiefe, and then of all mankind. </p>

        <l>NOw, luck yet send vs, and a little wit </l>

        <l>(According to the palates of the season) </l>
        <l>Here is ri'me, not emptie of reason: </l>
        <l>This we were bid to credit, from our Poet, </l>
        <l>Whose true scope, if you would know it, </l>
        <l>In all his poemes, stil, hath been this measure, </l>
        <l>To mixe profit, with your pleasure; </l>
        <l>And not as some (whose throats their enuy fayling) </l>
        <l>Cry hoarsely, all he writes, is rayling: </l>
        <l>And, when his playes come forth, thinke they can flout them, </l>
        <l>With saying, he was a yeere about them. </l>
        <l>To these there needs no lie, but this his creature, </l>
        <l>Which was, two months since, no feature; </l>
        <l>And, though he dares giue them fiue liues to mend it, </l>
        <l>'Tis knowne, fiue weekes fully pen'd it: </l>
        <pb n="450" xml:id="ep000096-245-a"/>
        <l>From his owne hand, without a co-adiutor, </l>
        <l>Nouice, iourney-man, or tutor. </l>
        <l>Yet, thus much I can giue you, as a token </l>
        <l>Of his playes worth, no egges are broken; </l>
        <l>Nor quaking custards with fierce teeth affrighted, </l>
        <l>Wherewith your rout are so delighted; </l>
        <l>Nor hales he in a gull, old ends reciting, </l>
        <l>To stop gaps in his loose writing; </l>
        <l>With such a deale of monstrous, and forc'd action: </l>
        <l>As might make Bet'lem a faction: </l>
        <l>Nor made he his play, for iests, stolne from each table, </l>
        <l>But makes iests, to fit his fable. </l>
        <l>And, so presents quick comoedie, refined, </l>
        <l>As best Criticks haue designed, </l>
        <l>The lawes of time, place, persons he obserueth, </l>
        <l>From no needfull rule he swerueth. </l>
        <l>All gall, and coppresse, from his inke, he drayneth, </l>
        <l>Onely, a little salt remayneth; </l>
        <l>Wherewith, he'll rub your cheeks, til (red with laughter) </l>

But may some other gallant fellow say, O, there be diuers, that make profession to haue as good, and as experimented receipts, as yours: Indeed, very many haue assay'd, like apes in imitation of that, which is really and essentially in mee, to make of this oyle; bestow'd great cost in furnaces, stilles, alembeks, continuall fires, and preparation of the ingredients, (as indeede there goes to it sixe hundred seuerall simples, besides, some quantity of humane fat, for the conglutination, which we buy of the anatomistes) but, when these practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff, puff, and all flies in fumo: ha, ha, ha. Poore wretches! I rather pittie their folly, and indiscretion, then their losse of time, and money; for those may be recouered by industrie: but to bee a foole borne, is a disease incurable. For my selfe, I alwaies from my youth haue indeuour'd to get the rarest secrets, and booke them; either in exchange, or for money: I spared nor cost, nor labour, where any thing was worthy to bee learned. And gentlemen, honourable gentlemen, I will vndertake (by vertue of chymicall art) out of the honourable hat, that couers your head, to extract the foure elements; that is to say, the fire, ayre, water, and earth, and returne you your felt without burne, or staine. For, whil'st others haue beene at the balloo, I haue beene at my booke: and am now past the craggie pathes of studie, and come to the flowrie plaines of honour, and reputation. </p>

Here is a poulder, conceal'd in this paper, of which, if I should speake to the worth, nine thousand volumes were but as one page, that page as a line, that line as a word: so short is this pilgrimage of man (which some call life) to the expressing of it. Would I reflect on the price? why, the whole world were but as an empire, that empire as a prouince, that prouince as a banke, that banke as a priuate purse, to the purchase of it. I will, onely, tell you; It is the poulder, that made VENVS a goddesse (giuen her by APOLLO) that kept her perpetually yong, clear'd her wrincles, firm'd her gummes, fill'd her skin, colour'd her haire; from her, deriu'd to HELEN, and at the sack of Troy (vnfortunately) lost: till now, in this our age, it was as happily recouer'd, by a studious Antiquarie, out of some ruines of Asia, who sent a moyetie of it, to the court of France (but much sophisticated) wherewith the ladies there, now, colour their haire. The rest (at this present) remaines with me; extracted, to a quintessence: so that, where euer it but touches, in youth it perpetually preserues, in age restores the complexion; seat's your teeth, did they dance like virginall iacks, firme as a wall; makes them white, as iuory, that were black, as— </p>
